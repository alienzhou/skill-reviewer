A universal Skill review tool with two modes: **Definition Review** (default) for validating Skill quality, and **Execution Review** for analyzing runtime performance.

## What is This?

**Skill Reviewer** is an AI-native tool designed to systematically analyze and improve AI Skills quality. It provides:

- **Definition Review** (Default): Validate Skill structure, format, content, and triggers against a 20-item checklist
- **Execution Review** (Explicit): Analyze runtime performance through three-layer progressive analysis

Think of it as a linter + code review system for AI Skills.

## Two Review Modes

### Mode A: Definition Review (Default)

Validate Skill quality with a **20-item checklist** across four categories:

| Category     | Focus                | Items |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----- |
| 📁 Structure | File/folder layout   | S1-S4 |
| 📋 Format    | YAML frontmatter     | F1-F5 |
| 📝 Content   | Instructions quality | C1-C8 |
| 🎯 Trigger   | Activation design    | T1-T3 |

### Mode B: Execution Review (Explicit)

Three-layer progressive analysis for runtime performance:

```
L1 Engineering Correctness ──▶ L2 Goal Achievement ──▶ L3 Optimization Space
   Is execution correct?         Is effect good?          Can it be better?
```

- **L1 (Engineering)**: Catches technical errors - syntax errors, failed calls, infinite loops
- **L2 (Goal)**: Evaluates effectiveness - is the task actually completed well?
- **L3 (Optimization)**: Identifies improvements - redundant calls, token efficiency, better approaches

## Features

- ✅ **Dual Mode**: Definition Review (default) + Execution Review (explicit)
- 📊 **Systematic**: 20-item checklist for definitions, 3-layer analysis for execution
- 🎯 **Actionable**: Provides specific, prioritized improvement suggestions
- 🔍 **Comprehensive**: Covers structure, format, content, triggers, and runtime

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- An AI editor that supports MCP Skills (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Access to filesystem (for symlinking)

### Install via Symlink

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vibe-x-ai/skill-reviewer.git
cd skill-reviewer

# Create symlink to your skills directory
ln -s $(pwd)/skill-reviewer ~/.claude/skills/skill-reviewer
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, the skill should appear in your AI editor's skill list. You can verify by asking your AI assistant:

```
"List available skills"
```

## Usage Guide

### In Claude Code

1. **Trigger the skill** by asking:

```
   "Review my skill"           # → Definition Review (default)
   "Check skill quality"       # → Definition Review
   "Analyze this execution"    # → Execution Review (explicit)
   "Review this trace"         # → Execution Review (explicit)
```

2. **For Definition Review** (default):

- Provide: Skill folder path (e.g., `./my-skill/`)
- Receive: 20-item checklist report with pass/warn/fail status

3. **For Execution Review** (explicit):

- Provide: Execution trace + original goal
- Optionally: Skill/Tool source code path
- Receive: L1/L2/L3 analysis report

**Example - Definition Review:**

```
You: Review my skill at ./my-skill/

Claude: [Reads folder structure, checks SKILL.md]
        [Runs 20-item checklist]
        [Generates review report]

# 🔍 Skill Review: my-skill
| Category | ✅ Pass | ⚠️ Warn | ❌ Fail |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| Structure | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Format | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Content | 6 | 2 | 0 |
| Trigger | 3 | 0 | 0 |
```

**Example - Execution Review:**

```
You: Analyze this skill execution

Claude: I'll help review the execution. Please provide:
1. [Required] Execution trace - The agent execution process
2. [Required] Execution goal - Your original prompt
3. [Optional] Which skill/tool was used?

You: [Paste execution trace]
     Goal: "Generate API documentation"

Claude: [Generates L1/L2/L3 analysis report]
```

### In Cursor

1. **Open Cursor** and ensure the skill is installed (symlinked to `~/.claude/skills/`)
2. **In chat or composer**, use natural language:

```
   "Review my skill at ./my-skill/"    # Definition Review
   "Check skill quality"                # Definition Review
   "Analyze this execution trace"       # Execution Review
```

3. **Provide context** by:

- Referencing skill folders with `@my-skill/`
- Pasting execution logs directly in chat
- Sharing terminal output

4. **Get instant feedback** with actionable suggestions

**Tips for Cursor:**

- Use `@skill-reviewer` to explicitly invoke the skill
- Reference skill folders for definition review
- Attach execution traces for runtime analysis

### In Others

If your editor supports MCP Skills:

1. **Install skill** via symlink to your editor's skills directory
2. **Trigger** by mentioning keywords:
   - Definition: "review skill", "check quality", "validate skill"
   - Execution: "analyze execution", "review trace"
3. **Follow prompts** to provide required inputs
4. **Review output** and apply suggestions

## FAQ

**Q: What's the difference between Definition Review and Execution Review?**
A: Definition Review checks Skill quality (SKILL.md structure, content). Execution Review analyzes runtime performance (tool calls, errors, efficiency).

**Q: When should I use which mode?**
A: Use Definition Review (default) when building/improving Skills. Use Execution Review when debugging runtime issues or optimizing performance.

**Q: Do I need to provide all inputs?**
A: For Definition Review, just provide the skill path. For Execution Review, trace + goal are required; others enhance analysis depth.

**Q: Can it review any Skill?**
A: Yes! It works with any SKILL.md-based Skill regardless of implementation.

**Q: How long does a review take?**
A: Definition Review: ~30 seconds. Execution Review: 1-2 minutes for full L1-L3 analysis.

**Q: Can I customize the checklist?**
A: The 20-item checklist is standard, but you can fork and modify for specific needs.
